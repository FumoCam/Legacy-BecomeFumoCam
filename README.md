# Unsupported Advanced Functionality 
For advanced commands like teleportation, use of a third party Lua injector is required (alongside some code).

This can lead to system instability and is challenging to develop around, so it has been made obsolete.

You can view the old code that still supported injector commands on the [injector support branch](https://github.com/<HISTORICALLY_REDACTED>).

In addition, it needs the injector module to be extracted into the project at the "resources/injector" path. You can find the injector here: < HISTORICALLY REDACTED >
